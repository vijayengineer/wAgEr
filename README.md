# wAgEr
Please see the medium article/blog for the concept behind the appÂ https://medium.com/p/2bc41eafc4e/

The idea for wAgEr came at a ETH London hackathon The goal is to create a basket of tokens which are a mixture of low risk and high risk assets. These can be used to create a return which can be quantified by a risk profile, and duration of the loan.
The project consists of an Android App with a Web3 wallet created automatically. This is to allow the users to easily onboard in the future with a simple loading mechanism. The wallet can be updated with the ETH Kovan faucet. In the backend a flask server instance running on digital ocean which is connected to the Amber datastream to update the portfolio using various parameters such as token Velocity, market movement, circulaing supply, top tokens. All this information is channeled based on the duration, risk profile to provide a personalized portfolio.
Project is organized as follows: 
At the front end is the Web3 app with a wallet generated by using smart contracts. The auto generated java files are included in this project The Android studio project is uploaded in the repository with the server instance for Digital Ocean. This server instance will expire in about 2 weeks i.e. April 15th.At the backend is the python or flask instance. User can update the flask files to configure with their own instance.
